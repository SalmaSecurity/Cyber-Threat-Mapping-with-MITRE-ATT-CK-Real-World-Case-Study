# Cyber-Threat-Mapping-with-MITRE-ATT-CK-Real-World-Case-Study
##*Objective:*
This project aims to map real-world cyber threats to the *MITRE ATT&CK* framework, focusing initially on a narrative report and later on analyzing security logs. By combining thorough threat analysis with automation, we streamline the process of identifying and classifying adversary tactics and techniques. Additionally, the project provides an in-depth breakdown of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, emphasizing its importance in defensive strategies for cybersecurity professionals.
